=== Ralph Progress Log ===

Started: 2026-01-16

Features completed:
- [2026-01-16] Feature 1: "System tracks processing status for each entry"
  - Added Migration 16: processed_at and content_hash columns to entries table
  - Added Migration 17: source_text, source_start, source_end columns to journal_insights table
  - Updated TypeScript types (JournalEntry, JournalInsight) with new optional fields
  - Updated EntryRow interface and rowToEntry function in src/services/entries.ts
  - Updated all SELECT queries in entries service to include new columns
  - Updated packages/core types and services to match
  - TypeScript compiles without errors

- [2026-01-17] Feature 2: "System can identify unprocessed entries"
  - Added getUnprocessedEntries() function to src/services/entries.ts
  - Added markEntryAsProcessed(id, contentHash) function to src/services/entries.ts
  - Added clearEntryProcessedStatus(id) function to src/services/entries.ts
  - These functions enable querying entries where processed_at IS NULL
  - TypeScript compiles without errors

- [2026-01-17] Feature 3: "System can process a single entry and generate insights"
  - Created src/services/entryAnalysis.ts with AI-powered entry analysis
  - analyzeEntry(entry): Uses OpenAI GPT-4o-mini to extract emotions and people from entry text
  - processEntry(entry): Full processing workflow - delete old insights, analyze, save new insights, mark as processed
  - generateContentHash(content): Hash function for detecting entry modifications
  - hasEntryBeenModified(entry): Checks if entry content has changed since last analysis
  - Updated saveInsights() in analytics.ts to include source_text, source_start, source_end fields
  - AI extracts emotions with: emotion name, intensity (1-10), trigger, sentiment, source location
  - AI extracts people with: name, relationship, sentiment, context, source location
  - Source positions are validated and corrected to ensure accuracy
  - Insights are saved with entry_id reference for navigation
  - TypeScript compiles without errors

- [2026-01-18] Feature 5: "Insights are stored with source text location metadata"
  - QA VERIFICATION (Code Inspection):
    1. ✅ Database schema verified in src-tauri/src/lib.rs
    2. ✅ entry_id foreign key field - Present in Migration 11: FOREIGN KEY (entry_id) REFERENCES entries(id)
    3. ✅ source_text TEXT field - Added in Migration 17
    4. ✅ source_start INTEGER field - Added in Migration 17
    5. ✅ source_end INTEGER field - Added in Migration 17
    6. ✅ insight_type TEXT NOT NULL field - Present in Migration 11
  - TypeScript types verified in src/types/analytics.ts (JournalInsight interface)
  - saveInsights() in analytics.ts saves all source location fields
  - TypeScript compiles without errors
  - ALL TEST STEPS PASS

- [2026-01-18] Feature 6: "System marks entries as processed after analysis"
  - QA VERIFICATION (Code Inspection):
    1. ✅ createEntry() does not set processed_at (new entries have null)
    2. ✅ processEntry() calls markEntryAsProcessed(entry.id, contentHash)
    3. ✅ markEntryAsProcessed() sets processed_at to current timestamp
    4. ✅ markEntryAsProcessed() sets content_hash from generateContentHash()
    5. ✅ getUnprocessedEntries() has WHERE processed_at IS NULL
  - Full workflow verified in src/services/entryAnalysis.ts:257-277
  - TypeScript compiles without errors
  - ALL TEST STEPS PASS

- [2026-01-18] Feature 7: "System detects when an entry has been modified"
  - QA VERIFICATION (Code Inspection):
    1. ✅ updateEntry() detects content changes by comparing old vs new content
    2. ✅ When content changes, generateContentHash() calculates new hash
    3. ✅ markEntryForReprocessing() updates content_hash with new value
    4. ✅ markEntryForReprocessing() sets processed_at to NULL
    5. ✅ Entry appears in getUnprocessedEntries() query (processed_at IS NULL)
    6. ✅ updateEntry() does NOT call deleteEntryInsights() - insights preserved
    7. ✅ Only processEntry() and deleteEntry() call deleteEntryInsights()
  - Implementation details:
    - Added import for generateContentHash from entryAnalysis.ts
    - updateEntry() now fetches current entry to compare content
    - New markEntryForReprocessing(id, newContentHash) function added
    - Content comparison: currentEntry.content !== updates.content
    - Only triggers on previously processed entries (processed_at !== null)
  - TypeScript compiles without errors
  - ALL 8 TEST STEPS PASS

Current task:
- Completed sixth iteration (Feature 7 verified)

Notes:
- This file tracks progress across Ralph iterations
- Each completed feature should be logged here with timestamp
- Include any important decisions or blockers encountered
- Feature 1 addresses PRD requirements for tracking processing status
- New fields are nullable to support existing entries without breaking changes
