      <h1>JournAi Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p class="meta">Effective date: February 22, 2026</p>

      <p>
        JournAi is a local-first journaling app. This policy explains what information is processed
        when you use JournAi and how that information is handled.
      </p>

      <h2>1. Information You Create in the App</h2>
      <p>
        JournAi stores the content you create in the app, including journal entries, todos, sticky
        notes, and app preferences. This data is stored locally on your device.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Optional AI Features</h2>
      <p>
        If you enable AI features and provide your own OpenAI API key, selected app content is sent
        to OpenAI to generate chat responses, summaries, embeddings, and insights that you request.
      </p>
      <p>
        OpenAI is an independent service provider, and its processing is governed by OpenAI's terms
        and privacy policy.
      </p>

      <h2>3. API Key Handling</h2>
      <p>
        When provided, your OpenAI API key is stored using platform secure storage (for example,
        iOS Keychain) and is not sold to third parties.
      </p>

      <h2>4. No Account Required</h2>
      <p>
        JournAi does not require account creation to use core functionality. The app is designed to
        operate offline for journaling features.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>JournAi does not sell your personal data.</li>
        <li>JournAi does not use third-party advertising SDKs.</li>
        <li>JournAi does not share your journal content except when you explicitly use AI features.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>6. Security</h2>
      <p>
        JournAi uses local encryption and app-level protections to help protect your data on device.
        No method of transmission or storage is perfectly secure, but we use reasonable safeguards
        appropriate to the app.
      </p>

      <h2>7. Your Choices</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>You can use JournAi without enabling AI features.</li>
        <li>You can export your data from the app at any time.</li>
        <li>You can delete local app data by removing content or uninstalling the app.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>
      <p>
        JournAi is not directed to children under 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal
        information from children under 13.
      </p>

      <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
      <p>
        We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. The latest version will be posted on
        this page with an updated effective date.
      </p>
